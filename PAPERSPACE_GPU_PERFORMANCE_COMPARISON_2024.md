## Conclusion

**Bottom Line**: Even upgrading from the M4000 to the A4000 (only $0.31/hour more) would give you:
- **3.2x faster processing** (7.5 min â†’ 2.3 min)
- **50% lower cost per simulation**
- **Ability to handle larger files** without timeouts
- **Higher reliability** and fewer failures

The A5000 or A100 would provide even more dramatic improvements, making complex simulations that currently take 7.5 minutes complete in under 2 minutes, while actually **reducing your cost per simulation** due to the faster processing times.

**Recommendation**: Start with A4000 for immediate benefits, then upgrade to A5000 or A100 based on your workload requirements and budget.
