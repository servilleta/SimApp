# Progress Tracking Analysis

## Current Issues

1. Frontend-Backend Communication Issues:
   - Frontend is still trying to make requests to simapp.ai instead of local API
   - Getting 504 Gateway Timeout errors
   - SyntaxError with HTML responses instead of JSON

2. Backend Progress Update Issues:
   - Warning: "coroutine 'update_simulation_progress' was never awaited"
   - Progress updates are not being sent properly during simulation phases
   - No micro-updates during formula evaluation (only seeing updates at major phase transitions)

3. GPU Random Generation Issues:
   - GPU benchmark validation failing
   - Falling back to CPU for random generation
   - GPU speedup reported as 1.00x (no acceleration)

4. Progress Tracking Architecture Issues:
   - Progress updates are too coarse-grained
   - No intermediate progress during formula evaluation
   - Missing progress updates during dependency analysis
   - Async progress queue not properly implemented

## Root Causes

1. API Configuration:
   - Frontend still has hardcoded references to simapp.ai
   - API base URL not properly configured in frontend
   - Network timeouts not properly handled

2. Progress Update Implementation:
   - update_simulation_progress is called without await
   - No micro-progress updates during heavy computation
   - Progress queue not properly integrated

3. GPU Integration:
   - GPU random generation not properly initialized
   - Missing error handling for GPU fallback
   - GPU validation checks too strict

4. Progress Tracking Design:
   - Progress updates too focused on phase transitions
   - Missing granular progress during computation
   - No proper progress interpolation

## Improvement Plan

1. Frontend API Configuration (Priority: HIGH)
   - Remove all hardcoded simapp.ai references
   - Implement proper API base URL configuration
   - Add robust error handling for network issues
   - Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff

2. Backend Progress Updates (Priority: HIGH)
   - Fix async update_simulation_progress calls
   - Implement micro-progress updates during computation
   - Add progress tracking for dependency analysis
   - Properly integrate async progress queue

3. GPU Integration (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Fix GPU random generation initialization
   - Implement proper GPU fallback mechanism
   - Adjust GPU validation thresholds
   - Add detailed GPU error reporting

4. Progress Tracking Enhancement (Priority: HIGH)
   - Implement fine-grained progress updates
   - Add progress tracking for all computation phases
   - Implement smooth progress interpolation
   - Add detailed progress metadata

5. Progress Queue Implementation (Priority: HIGH)
   - Implement async progress queue
