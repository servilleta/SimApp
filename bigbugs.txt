# BIG ENGINE â€“ Active Bug Log (2025-06-24)

## âœ… FIXED ISSUES (2025-06-24 12:02 UTC)

### 1. VariableConfig Attribute Errors
**Problem**: BIG engine was trying to access `.sheet` and `.cell` on VariableConfig objects
**Solution**: Fixed to use correct attributes:
- `input_config.sheet_name` instead of `input_config.sheet`
- `input_config.name` instead of `input_config.cell`
- `const.sheet_name` instead of `const.sheet`
- `const.name` instead of `const.cell`

### 2. Formula Normalization Issues
**Problem**: Raw lists were causing `'list' object has no attribute 'get'` errors
**Solution**: Implemented robust formula normalization:
- Added `BigMonteCarloEngine.normalise_formulas_dict()` call
- Applied recursive normalizer to handle all formula shapes
- Defensive `_add_dep_nodes` function with proper type checking

### 3. Method Parameter Order
**Problem**: `chunked_bfs` was called with wrong parameter order
**Solution**: Fixed parameter order to `(start_nodes, graph, batch_size)`

### 4. Missing Imports
**Problem**: Missing numpy import for statistical calculations
**Solution**: Added `import numpy as np` to BIG engine function

### 5. Formulas Parameter Type
**Problem**: Formulas dict had string keys but method expected tuple keys
**Solution**: Added conversion from string keys to (sheet, cell) tuple keys

### 6. Sensitivity Analysis Format Error
**Problem**: `sensitivity_analysis` field expected `List[Dict[str, Any]]` but received `Dict[str, Any]`
**Solution**: Added conversion from dictionary to list format:
```python
sensitivity_list = []
for cell_key, sensitivity_info in sensitivity_data.items():
    sensitivity_list.append({
        'cell': cell_key,
        'impact': sensitivity_info['impact'],
        'correlation': sensitivity_info['correlation'],
        'rank': sensitivity_info['rank']
    })
```

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Formula Normalization Flow
1. Load raw formulas via `get_formulas_for_file(file_id)`
2. Apply `BigMonteCarloEngine.normalise_formulas_dict()` to handle mixed shapes
3. Process normalized formulas in `_add_dep_nodes()` with defensive type checking
4. Convert to tuple keys for Monte Carlo simulation

### Defensive Programming
- All `.get()` calls now check `isinstance(x, dict)` first
- Invalid cell coordinates are logged and skipped
- Nested lists are flattened recursively
- Empty/invalid precedents are filtered out

## ðŸ§ª TESTING STATUS
- âœ… Backend starts successfully without syntax errors
- âœ… BIG engine initialization completes
- âœ… Formula normalization methods are available
- âœ… VariableConfig attribute errors fixed
- âœ… Sensitivity analysis format fixed
- âœ… All critical validation errors resolved
- ðŸŽ¯ **READY FOR END-TO-END TESTING** - BIG engine should now complete simulations successfully

## ðŸ“‹ REMAINING TASKS
1. **Test with actual large Excel file** to verify end-to-end functionality
2. **Monitor simulation progress** to ensure proper graph building
3. **Validate Monte Carlo results** against expected outputs
4. **Performance optimization** if needed for very large files

## UPDATE 2025-01-24: BIG Engine Still Failing Despite Fixes

### Current Status
- BIG engine is being selected and executed
- Simulations complete in ~6 seconds (too fast for proper formula evaluation)
- Progress shows 100% completion for all variables (I6, J6, K6)
- BUT: No results are displayed in the UI

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Dependency Graph Building Failure**
   - Logs show: `[BIG ENGINE] Encoded dependency graph with 0 nodes.`
   - This means the BIG engine cannot build a proper formula dependency graph
   - Without a dependency graph, it cannot evaluate formulas properly
   - Results in empty/invalid simulation results

2. **Formula Data Structure Mismatch**
   - The BIG engine expects formulas in format: `{(sheet, cell): {precedents: [...]}}`
   - But it's receiving: `{'Complex': {'A1': '=formula', 'B2': '=formula', ...}}`
   - The normalise_formulas_dict method is failing to handle this nested structure

3. **Invalid Cell Coordinate Errors**
   - Logs show: `[BIG ENGINE] Invalid cell coordinate 'Complex!F10006'`
   - The BIG engine is trying to parse full sheet!cell references as just cell coordinates
   - This causes the coordinate validation to fail

### Proposed Solution Plan

#### Phase 1: Fix Formula Data Structure Handling
1. **Update normalise_formulas_dict in big_engine.py**
   - Properly handle the nested sheet structure `{'SheetName': {cells...}}`
   - Extract precedents from formula strings using regex
   - Build proper precedent lists for each cell

2. **Fix coordinate parsing in _add_dep_nodes**
   - Handle cases where sheet name is already included in the coordinate
   - Split 'Complex!A1' into ('Complex', 'A1') properly
   - Validate only the cell part, not the full reference

#### Phase 2: Enhance Formula Parsing
1. **Implement proper formula precedent extraction**
   - Use regex to find all cell references in formulas
   - Handle different reference formats: A1, $A$1, Sheet!A1, 'Sheet Name'!A1
   - Build accurate precedent lists for dependency graph

2. **Add logging for debugging**
   - Log sample formulas being processed
   - Log extracted precedents
   - Log final graph structure

#### Phase 3: Result Handling
1. **Ensure proper result format**
   - Verify BIG engine returns results in expected format
   - Add error handling for empty results
   - Ensure results are properly stored and retrievable

2. **Add fallback mechanism**
   - If dependency graph is empty, fall back to simple random sampling
   - Log warnings when falling back
   - Still return valid results even without formula evaluation

### Implementation Priority
1. Fix formula data structure handling (Critical)
2. Fix coordinate parsing (Critical)  
3. Add proper precedent extraction (High)
4. Enhance logging (Medium)
5. Add fallback mechanism (Medium)

### Expected Outcome
After implementing these fixes:
- BIG engine should build a proper dependency graph with thousands of nodes
- Formula evaluation should work correctly
- Results should be displayed in the UI
- Simulation time should increase (proper evaluation takes longer than 6 seconds)

### Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 1 fixes first (data structure and coordinate parsing)
2. Test with the large Excel file
3. If still failing, implement Phase 2 (enhanced parsing)
4. Add Phase 3 as safety net (fallback and error handling)
