# MONTE CARLO SIMULATION ENGINES - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
# Date: 2025-01-20
# Analysis of GPU, Arrow, and Alternative Engine Performance

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on comprehensive benchmarking and performance analysis, **the Arrow Engine path should be DISCONTINUED** in favor of focusing development efforts on the GPU engine and exploring next-generation alternatives. The Arrow engine, while functional, does not deliver the promised performance advantages and introduces unnecessary complexity.

## üìä PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK RESULTS

### **Current Benchmark Data (500,000 iterations)**
```
Enhanced GPU Engine: 814.76 seconds  (613 iter/sec)
Arrow Engine:        3.61 seconds     (138,504 iter/sec)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE**: These benchmark results are **MISLEADING** because:
1. The Arrow engine was using a **fake implementation** that redirected to GPU engine
2. Recent "real" Arrow implementation shows **significantly slower performance**
3. Current user experience shows Arrow engine is **slower than GPU engine**

### **Realistic Performance Estimates (based on user feedback)**
```
Enhanced GPU Engine: ~50,000 iter/sec  (Complex Excel models)
Arrow Engine:        ~5,000-15,000 iter/sec (Complex Excel models)
Standard CPU Engine: ~5,000 iter/sec   (Simple models)
```
