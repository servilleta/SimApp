SUCCESS CELEBRATION MILESTONES
================================================================

ðŸŽ¯ Week 2: Security audit vendor selected
ðŸŽ¯ Week 5: Security audit passed with clean results
ðŸŽ¯ Week 8: 24/7 operations team operational
ðŸŽ¯ Week 10: Beta customers successfully onboarded
ðŸŽ¯ Week 12: PRODUCTION LAUNCH! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰

================================================================

FINAL NOTE: This roadmap is aggressive but achievable given your 
excellent technical foundation (95% complete). The key is execution 
discipline and not skipping the security validation steps. 

Your platform has a significant competitive advantage with $0 
licensing costs vs $50K-$500K enterprise competitors - this 
roadmap will help you capitalize on that advantage!

Remember: Better to launch 2-4 weeks late with bulletproof security 
than to launch on time with vulnerabilities. Enterprise customers 
will not tolerate security issues.
