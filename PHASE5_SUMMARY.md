# Phase 5: Production Deployment - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 5 represents the final transformation of the Monte Carlo Platform from development to production-ready infrastructure. This phase implements enterprise-grade deployment capabilities, SSL/HTTPS security, load balancing, monitoring, backup systems, and performance optimization to achieve 100% launch readiness.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Key Achievements

- Content Security Policy with Stripe integration

#### ⚖️ Load Balancing & High Availability
- Nginx reverse proxy with production configuration
- Backend load balancing with least_conn algorithm
- Health checks for all services (30s intervals)
- Rate limiting: 10 req/s API, 1 req/s auth
- Connection limiting: 20 concurrent per IP

#### 📊 Comprehensive Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus metrics collection (15s intervals)
- Grafana dashboards with automated provisioning
- Application metrics at `/metrics` endpoint
- System monitoring for CPU, memory, disk
- Health checks with automated alerts

#### 💾 Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Automated database backups with compression
- File system backups with tar.gz format
- 30-day retention with automated cleanup
- Backup verification and integrity checks

```

### Verification
```bash
# Run test suite
python test_phase5.py

# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f
```
