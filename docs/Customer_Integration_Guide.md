## ðŸ“‹ **Customer Integration Examples**

### **Example 1: Python Integration**
```python
import requests
import json

# Your customer's API key
API_KEY = "ak_your_key_id_sk_your_secret_key"
BASE_URL = "http://209.51.170.185:8000/simapp-api"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
}

# Step 1: Upload Excel model
def upload_model(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        files = {'file': file}
        data = {
            'model_name': 'Portfolio Risk Model',
            'description': 'Q4 2024 portfolio analysis'
        }
        
        response = requests.post(
            f"{BASE_URL}/models",
            headers=headers,
            files=files,
            data=data
        )
        return response.json()

# Step 2: Run simulation
def run_simulation(model_id):
    simulation_config = {
        "model_id": model_id,
        "simulation_config": {
            "iterations": 100000,
            "variables": [
                {
                    "cell": "B5",
                    "distribution": {
                        "type": "triangular",
                        "min": 0.05,
                        "mode": 0.15,
                        "max": 0.35
                    }
                }
            ],
            "output_cells": ["J25", "K25"],
            "confidence_levels": [0.95, 0.99],
            "webhook_url": "https://customer-app.com/simulation-complete"
        }
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/simulations",
        headers=headers,
        json=simulation_config
    )
    return response.json()

# Step 3: Get results
def get_results(simulation_id):
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/simulations/{simulation_id}/results",
        headers=headers
    )
    return response.json()

# Usage example
model = upload_model("portfolio_model.xlsx")
simulation = run_simulation(model["model_id"])
results = get_results(simulation["simulation_id"])

print(f"Portfolio VaR 95%: ${results['results']['J25']['statistics']['var_95']:,.0f}")
```

### **Example 2: JavaScript/Node.js Integration**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
const FormData = require('form-data');
const fs = require('fs');

const API_KEY = 'ak_your_key_id_sk_your_secret_key';
const BASE_URL = 'http://209.51.170.185:8000/simapp-api';

const headers = {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
};

// Upload model
async function uploadModel(filePath) {
    const form = new FormData();
    form.append('file', fs.createReadStream(filePath));
    form.append('model_name', 'Risk Analysis Model');
    
    const response = await axios.post(`${BASE_URL}/models`, form, {
        headers: {
            ...headers,
            ...form.getHeaders()
        }
    });
    
    return response.data;
}

// Run simulation
async function runSimulation(modelId) {
    const config = {
        model_id: modelId,
        simulation_config: {
            iterations: 50000,
            variables: [{
                cell: 'B5',
                distribution: {
                    type: 'normal',
                    mean: 0.08,
                    std: 0.02
                }
            }],
            output_cells: ['J25']
        }
    };
    
    const response = await axios.post(`${BASE_URL}/simulations`, config, { headers });
    return response.data;
}

// Usage
uploadModel('./model.xlsx')
    .then(model => runSimulation(model.model_id))
    .then(simulation => console.log('Simulation started:', simulation.simulation_id));
```

### **Example 3: Excel/VBA Integration**
```vb
' VBA code for Excel users
Sub RunMonteCarloAPI()
    Dim http As Object
    Set http = CreateObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP")
    
    ' API Configuration
    Dim apiKey As String
    apiKey = "ak_your_key_id_sk_your_secret_key"
    
    Dim url As String
    url = "http://209.51.170.185:8000/simapp-api/health"
    
    ' Test API connection
    http.Open "GET", url, False
    http.setRequestHeader "Authorization", "Bearer " & apiKey
    http.send
    
    If http.Status = 200 Then
        MsgBox "API Connected Successfully!"
        ' Proceed with file upload and simulation
    Else
        MsgBox "API Connection Failed: " & http.Status
    End If
End Sub
```

## ðŸ“ž **Sales Script & Talking Points**

### **Opening Hook:**
*"What if you could run Monte Carlo simulations 100x faster without changing your Excel models? Our GPU-accelerated API transforms any Excel financial model into enterprise-grade risk analysis in minutes, not hours."*

### **Key Benefits to Emphasize:**

#### **For FinTech Startups:**
- "Add professional risk analysis to your app without hiring a quant team"
- "Scale from prototype to enterprise without rebuilding"
- "Your users upload Excel models, you get instant Monte Carlo results"

#### **For Banks/Financial Institutions:**
- "Regulatory compliance made simple - stress test any portfolio"
- "10-1000x faster than traditional CPU-based solutions"
- "No model conversion required - works with existing Excel infrastructure"

#### **For Software Vendors:**
- "White-label risk analysis feature for your platform"
- "One API call transforms you into a financial analytics company"
- "Your customers get enterprise-grade simulation without enterprise costs"

### **Objection Handling:**

**"We already have Excel"**
â†’ *"Perfect! Our API works with your existing Excel models. The difference is speed - what takes hours in Excel takes seconds with our GPU acceleration."*

**"Sounds complicated to integrate"**
â†’ *"It's actually simpler than Stripe payments. One API call uploads your Excel file, another runs the simulation. We'll do a live integration demo right now."*

**"What about security?"**
â†’ *"Enterprise-grade security with API keys, rate limiting, and isolated processing. Your models never leave our secure environment and are deleted after processing."*

### **Pattern 2: Automated Stress Testing**
Customer sets up scheduled API calls to run stress tests on their portfolios automatically (daily/weekly/monthly).

### **Pattern 3: White-Label Risk Analysis**
Customer embeds your API into their platform and offers "Monte Carlo Analysis" as their own feature to their customers.

### **Pattern 4: Regulatory Reporting**
Customer uses API to generate required regulatory stress test reports automatically.
