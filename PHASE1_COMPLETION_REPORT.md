## 🔧 Technical Debt Addressed

### Before (Monolith)
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to test individual features
- Single point of failure
- Hard to scale specific functionality

### After (Modular Monolith)
- Loose coupling through protocols
- Each service independently testable
- Fault isolation between services
- Service-specific scaling preparation

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Current State
- **V1 Production**: `main-v1-production` - Ready for immediate deployment
- **V2 Development**: `main-v2-modular` - Modular architecture complete

### Recommended Approach
1. **Deploy V1** for immediate production needs
2. **Validate V2** through comprehensive testing
3. **Gradual Migration** when V2 testing complete
4. **Feature Flag** controlled rollout
