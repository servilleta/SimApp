- **Streaming Evaluation**: Processes large ranges in 100-cell chunks
- **Memory Optimization**: Intelligent caching with 2000-item limit
- **Parallel Processing**: 8 worker threads for complex calculations
- **Smart Dependencies**: Range-aware dependency graph

#### 2. Upgraded Arrow Processor (`arrow_formula_processor.py`)
- **Complex Detection**: Automatically identifies large dependency chains
- **Enhanced Integration**: Uses `EnhancedFormulaEngine` instead of basic engine
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks cache hits, evaluation times, complex formulas
- **Batch Optimization**: Processes Monte Carlo batches in 100-item chunks
- **Memory Management**: Periodic cleanup and optimization

#### 3. Advanced Excel Function Support
- **SUM Enhanced**: `_sum_enhanced()` with numpy vectorization
- **Range Functions**: Optimized AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN with streaming
- **Memory Efficient**: No longer loads entire dependency chains upfront
- **Error Resilient**: Graceful handling of missing or invalid data

## 🎯 Expected Resolution

### Problem: Zero Results for Complex Formulas
**Before Enhancement:**
- **I6**: `SUM(I8:I208)` → Range expansion (200+ cells) → Memory overload → Zero result
- **J6**: `SUM(J8:J208)` → Range expansion (200+ cells) → Memory overload → Zero result
- **K6**: `J6/I6` → 0/0 → Undefined → Random/incorrect result

**After Enhancement:**
- **I6**: `SUM(I8:I208)` → Range object → Streaming evaluation → **Proper sum result**
- **J6**: `SUM(J8:J208)` → Range object → Streaming evaluation → **Proper sum result** 
- **K6**: `J6/I6` → Proper division → **Realistic result**

### Dependency Chain Handling
**Complex Model Support:**
- **600+ Interdependent Cells**: Now handled efficiently
