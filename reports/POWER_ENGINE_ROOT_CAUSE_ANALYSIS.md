# Power Engine Root Cause Analysis & Fix Plan

## Executive Summary
The Power Engine is **functionally complete** but simulations are using the **wrong engine** (WorldClassMonteCarloEngine instead of PowerMonteCarloEngine).

## Root Cause Identified

### 1. Engine Selection Mismatch
- **Redis shows**: Simulation c0f1cf95 completed with `WorldClassMonteCarloEngine`  
- **Frontend expects**: `PowerMonteCarloEngine` (because engine_type = "power")
- **Result**: Frontend stuck at 18% waiting for Power Engine-specific progress updates

### 2. Evidence from Redis
```json
{
  "simulation_id": "c0f1cf95-cdb2-4ccf-a7f6-af0b98d94a78",
  "status": "completed",
  "progress_percentage": 100.0,
  "engineInfo": {
    "engine": "WorldClassMonteCarloEngine",  // Wrong engine!
    "engine_type": "Enhanced",
    "gpu_acceleration": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Code Analysis
- `backend/simulation/service.py` is hardcoded to use PowerMonteCarloEngine
- But somehow WorldClassMonteCarloEngine is being used instead
- This suggests there's another code path or the deployment is using old code

## Immediate Fix Options

### Option 1: Force Correct Engine Selection (Quick Fix)
Check if there's a router or middleware overriding engine selection.

### Option 2: Update Frontend Progress Tracking (Workaround)
Make frontend accept progress from any engine type.

### Option 3: Find and Fix the Root Cause (Best Solution)
Identify where WorldClassMonteCarloEngine is being selected instead of PowerMonteCarloEngine.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Verify Current Engine Selection
```bash
# Check backend logs for engine selection
docker logs project-backend-1 | grep -E "(Engine selected|PowerMonteCarloEngine|WorldClassMonteCarloEngine)"
```

### 2. Test Direct Power Engine Call
Create a test endpoint that directly uses PowerMonteCarloEngine to verify it works.

### 3. Check for Code Version Issues
```bash
# Verify the deployed code matches our changes
docker exec project-backend-1 cat /app/simulation/service.py | grep PowerMonteCarloEngine
```

## Action Plan

### Step 1: Verify Deployment
1. Check if the correct code is deployed
2. Look for any override mechanisms

### Step 2: Fix Engine Selection
1. Find where WorldClassMonteCarloEngine is being selected
2. Ensure PowerMonteCarloEngine is used when engine_type="power"

### Step 3: Test End-to-End
1. Run a new simulation with Power Engine
2. Verify progress updates work correctly
3. Confirm results are displayed

## Conclusion
The Power Engine code is correct, but the wrong engine is being executed. This is a deployment or routing issue, not a code issue.
