## 🧪 SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGY & ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### **Monte Carlo Simulation Theory**
- **Statistical Sampling**: Generate thousands of possible scenarios using probability distributions
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Transform input uncertainties into output risk profiles
- **Convergence Analysis**: Ensure statistical validity through iteration control
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identify key drivers of uncertainty and risk

### **Advanced Sampling Techniques**

#### **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**
Latin Hypercube Sampling is a stratified sampling technique that ensures optimal coverage of the entire probability space with fewer samples than traditional random sampling:

- **Mathematical Foundation**: Divides each input variable's probability distribution into N equal probability intervals, then selects exactly one sample from each interval
- **Variance Reduction**: Achieves up to 50% reduction in simulation variance compared to pure random sampling
- **Orthogonal Design**: Ensures that samples are evenly distributed across all dimensions of the input space
- **Implementation**: Uses scipy.stats.qmc.LatinHypercube with optimization for correlation control
- **Convergence Speed**: Typically requires 10x fewer iterations to achieve the same statistical accuracy

#### **Sobol Sequences (Quasi-Random Numbers)**
Sobol sequences are low-discrepancy sequences that provide superior convergence properties for Monte Carlo integration:

- **Quasi-Random Theory**: Deterministic sequences that fill space more uniformly than pseudo-random numbers
- **Discrepancy Bound**: Theoretical guarantee of O((log N)^d/N) convergence rate vs O(N^(-1/2)) for random sampling
- **Multi-Dimensional Uniformity**: Maintains uniformity properties in projections onto lower-dimensional subspaces
- **Implementation**: Custom Sobol generator optimized for GPU parallel processing
- **Applications**: Particularly effective for high-dimensional financial models (>10 variables)

#### **Stratified Sampling & Variance Reduction**
- **Control Variates**: Uses known analytical relationships to reduce simulation variance
- **Antithetic Variables**: Generates negatively correlated pairs of random numbers to cancel out variance
- **Importance Sampling**: Focuses computational effort on regions of highest impact
- **Moment Matching**: Ensures sample statistics match theoretical distribution properties
