# Admin Panel API Endpoints Fix

## Problem Description

The admin panel in the SimApp was showing errors when trying to:
1. **Delete simulations**: "Method Not Allowed" error
2. **Clean cache**: "Not Found" error

## Root Cause Analysis

The frontend (`AdminLogsPage.jsx`) was making API calls to endpoints that didn't exist in the backend:

```javascript
// Frontend was calling these endpoints:
DELETE /api/simulations/{simulation_id}           // ❌ Missing
POST /api/simulations/{simulation_id}/clean-cache // ❌ Missing
```

But the backend (`simulation/router.py`) only had:
```python
# Existing endpoints:
POST /api/simulations/{simulation_id}/cancel      // ✅ Existed
GET /api/simulations/history                      // ✅ Existed  
GET /api/simulations/active                       // ✅ Existed
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added DELETE Endpoint for Simulation Deletion

```python
@router.delete("/{simulation_id}", status_code=200)
async def delete_simulation(
    simulation_id: str = Path(..., title="The ID of the simulation to delete"),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """Delete a simulation from the results store (admin only)."""
    if not current_user.is_admin:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Admin privilege required")
    
    # Remove from SIMULATION_RESULTS_STORE
    # Clean up result files: results/*{simulation_id}*
    # Clean up cache files: cache/*{simulation_id}*
    
    return {
        "simulation_id": simulation_id,
        "status": "deleted",
        "message": "Simulation deleted successfully"
    }
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Admin-only access control
- ✅ Removes simulation from memory store
- ✅ Cleans up associated result files
- ✅ Cleans up associated cache files
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Detailed logging

### 2. Added POST Endpoint for Cache Cleaning

```python
@router.post("/{simulation_id}/clean-cache", status_code=200)
async def clean_simulation_cache(
    simulation_id: str = Path(..., title="The ID of the simulation to clean cache for"),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """Clean cache files for a specific simulation (admin only)."""
    if not current_user.is_admin:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Admin privilege required")
    
    # Clean cache files: cache/*{simulation_id}*
    # Clean temp files: uploads/*{simulation_id}*
    
    return {
        "simulation_id": simulation_id,
        "status": "cache_cleaned",
        "message": f"Cache cleaned successfully - {len(cleaned_files)} files removed",
        "files_cleaned": len(cleaned_files),
        "bytes_freed": total_size
    }
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Admin-only access control
- ✅ Cleans cache directory files
- ✅ Cleans temporary upload files
- ✅ Reports files cleaned and bytes freed
- ✅ Safe file handling with error recovery
- ✅ Detailed logging

## API Endpoints Summary

After the fix, the complete admin simulation management API includes:

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Access |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/simulations/history` | List all simulations | Admin |
| `GET` | `/api/simulations/active` | List running simulations | Admin |
| `POST` | `/api/simulations/{id}/cancel` | Cancel running simulation | Admin |
| `DELETE` | `/api/simulations/{id}` | **🆕 Delete simulation** | Admin |
| `POST` | `/api/simulations/{id}/clean-cache` | **🆕 Clean cache** | Admin |

## Frontend Integration

The admin panel (`AdminLogsPage.jsx`) now works seamlessly:

```javascript
// Delete simulation - now works ✅
const deleteSimulation = async (simId) => {
  await axios.delete(`${API_BASE_URL}/simulations/${simId}`, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${getToken()}` },
  });
};

// Clean cache - now works ✅  
const cleanCache = async (simId) => {
  await axios.post(`${API_BASE_URL}/simulations/${simId}/clean-cache`, {}, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${getToken()}` },
  });
};
```

## Security Features

Both new endpoints include:
- ✅ **Authentication required**: Must be logged in
- ✅ **Admin authorization**: Only admin users can access
- ✅ **Input validation**: Simulation ID validation
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ **Audit logging**: All operations are logged

## File Cleanup Logic

### Delete Simulation
1. Remove from `SIMULATION_RESULTS_STORE` (memory)
2. Delete files matching `results/*{simulation_id}*`
3. Delete files matching `cache/*{simulation_id}*`
4. Log all operations

### Clean Cache
1. Delete files matching `cache/*{simulation_id}*`
2. Delete files matching `uploads/*{simulation_id}*`
3. Calculate and report bytes freed
4. Log all operations

## Deployment

The fix was deployed by:
1. ✅ Adding endpoints to `backend/simulation/router.py`
2. ✅ Restarting backend container: `docker-compose restart backend`
3. ✅ Verified API functionality
4. ✅ No frontend changes needed (endpoints matched existing calls)

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Delete Simulation**: Now returns success instead of "Method Not Allowed"
- ✅ **Clean Cache**: Now returns success instead of "Not Found"
- ✅ **Admin Panel**: Fully functional simulation management
- ✅ **Security**: Admin-only access enforced
- ✅ **File Cleanup**: Proper disk space management

## Impact

This fix enables administrators to:
- 🗑️ **Delete old simulations** to free up memory and disk space
- 🧹 **Clean cache files** to manage disk usage
- 📊 **Maintain system performance** through proper cleanup
- 🔒 **Secure admin operations** with proper authorization

The admin panel is now fully functional for simulation lifecycle management.
