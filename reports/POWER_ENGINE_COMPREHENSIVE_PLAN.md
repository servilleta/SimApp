# Power Engine Comprehensive Fix Plan
## Date: July 3, 2025
## Status: Progress Updates Not Working (Engine Itself Working)

---

## üîß CURRENT ACTIONS TAKEN

### Debug Logging Added (July 3, 2025)
I've added comprehensive debug logging to trace progress callback execution:

1. **Power Engine Startup**:
   - Logs whether progress callback is available
   - Shows the type of progress callback object

2. **Each Progress Stage**:
   - Logs when attempting to call progress callback
   - Logs success or failure of callback execution
   - Shows detailed error messages if callback fails

3. **Backend Restart**:
   - Docker container restarted to apply changes
   - Ready for testing with enhanced logging

### Next Steps
1. User runs a test simulation with Power Engine
2. Check backend logs for debug output patterns
3. Based on findings, implement targeted fix

See `POWER_ENGINE_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed testing guide.

## üéâ GOOD NEWS: Power Engine is Working!

The backend logs confirm that the Power Engine IS successfully:
- ‚úÖ Completing simulations in ~85 seconds
- ‚úÖ Generating real Monte Carlo results with proper variance
- ‚úÖ Mean: ~14 million, Standard Deviation: ~275k  
- ‚úÖ Processing 1000 iterations correctly
- ‚úÖ Updating task status to "completed"

## üî¥ THE ISSUE: Progress Updates Not Being Sent

### Current Behavior
1. Simulation starts and gets queued
2. Power Engine begins processing
3. **NO progress callbacks are executed** (this is the issue)
4. Frontend stuck at 18% because it never receives progress updates
5. Power Engine completes successfully after ~85 seconds
6. Final status is updated to "completed"
7. Frontend eventually shows results (but user experience is poor)

### Root Cause Analysis

The progress callbacks are:
1. ‚úÖ Defined in the Power Engine code
2. ‚úÖ Being passed from service.py to PowerMonteCarloEngine
3. ‚ùå **NOT being executed during simulation stages**

This suggests the issue is in the Power Engine's `run()` method where the callbacks should be invoked but aren't.

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Step 1: Verify Progress Callback Execution
**Issue**: Progress callbacks are defined but not being called
**Fix**: Add debug logging to verify callbacks are reachable

```python
# In power_engine.py run() method
async def run(self) -> SimulationResult:
    self.log.info(f"üéØ Starting Power Engine simulation: {self.target_cell_name}")
    self.log.info(f"üîç Progress callback available: {self.progress_callback is not None}")
    
    # Stage 1: File Upload & Validation
    if self.progress_callback:
        self.log.info("üì§ Calling progress callback for Stage 1")
        self.progress_callback({...})
    else:
        self.log.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è No progress callback available!")
```

### Step 2: Fix Async/Await Issues
**Possible Issue**: The progress callback might need to be awaited
**Current**: `self.progress_callback({...})`
**May Need**: `await self.progress_callback({...})` if callback is async

### Step 3: Ensure Progress Store Updates
**Verify**: The progress_callback in service.py is calling update_simulation_progress()
**Check**: Progress data is being written to Redis/storage correctly

---

## üìã TESTING PLAN

### Test 1: Progress Callback Verification
1. Add debug logging at each progress callback point
2. Run simulation and check backend logs for:
   - "Calling progress callback for Stage X"
   - "Progress callback available: True"
3. Verify all 5 stages attempt to send updates

### Test 2: Frontend Progress Updates
1. Open browser developer console
2. Run Power Engine simulation
3. Monitor for progress updates in console logs
4. Expected: Progress should go 20% ‚Üí 40% ‚Üí 60% ‚Üí 80% ‚Üí 100%
5. Current: Stuck at 18%

### Test 3: Backend Progress Store
Check if progress is being stored:
```bash
docker exec -it project-redis-1 redis-cli
> KEYS *c0f1cf95*  # Use your simulation ID
> GET simulation_progress:c0f1cf95-xxxx
```

---

## üöÄ QUICK FIXES TO TRY

### Fix 1: Force Progress Update (Temporary)
Add a manual progress update right after engine creation:
```python
# In service.py after engine creation
update_simulation_progress(sim_id, {
    "status": "running",
    "progress_percentage": 25,
    "stage": "initialization",
    "message": "Power Engine started"
})
```

### Fix 2: Add Heartbeat Updates
During long-running operations, send periodic updates:
```python
# In power_engine.py during batch processing
if i % 10 == 0:  # Every 10 batches
    if self.progress_callback:
        self.progress_callback({
            "progress_percentage": 80 + int((i / num_batches) * 20),
            "stage": "simulation",
            "current_iteration": i * BATCH_SIZE
        })
```

## üìù KNOWN WORKING PARTS

1. **Power Engine Core**: ‚úÖ Fully functional
   - Processes formulas correctly
   - Generates proper Monte Carlo variance
   - Returns valid SimulationResult objects

2. **Service Integration**: ‚úÖ Working
   - Task queuing works
   - Engine initialization correct
   - Results properly stored

3. **Frontend Polling**: ‚úÖ Working
   - Polls every ~1.5 seconds
   - Correctly displays results when available
   - Status endpoint functioning

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After implementing fixes, the user should see:

1. **Smooth Progress Updates**:
   - 0% ‚Üí 20% (Initialization)
   - 20% ‚Üí 40% (Parsing)
   - 40% ‚Üí 60% (Analysis)
   - 60% ‚Üí 80% (Simulation)
   - 80% ‚Üí 100% (Results)

2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Real-time progress feedback
   - No more "stuck at 18%"
   - Clear indication of what's happening

3. **Same Great Results**:
   - Mean: ~14 million
   - Std Dev: ~275k
   - Completion in ~85 seconds

## üîç DEBUGGING COMMANDS

### Check Current Simulation Status
```bash
# Check backend logs for simulation
docker logs project-backend-1 | grep "c0f1cf95"

# Check if progress callbacks are being called
docker logs project-backend-1 | grep -i "progress callback"

# Check Redis for progress data
docker exec -it project-redis-1 redis-cli KEYS "*progress*"
```

### Monitor Real-time Progress
```bash
# Watch backend logs in real-time
docker logs -f project-backend-1 | grep -E "(Progress|Stage|c0f1cf95)"
```

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHT

The Power Engine is **functionally complete** and working correctly. The only issue is that progress updates aren't being sent to the frontend during execution. This is a relatively minor issue that affects user experience but not the actual simulation results.

**Bottom Line**: The engine works, we just need to fix the progress reporting!
