# Power Engine Testing Instructions

## Current Status

I've added debug logging to the Power Engine to help diagnose why progress updates aren't being sent to the frontend. The Power Engine itself is working correctly and generating proper results, but the progress callbacks appear to not be executing.

## How to Test

### 1. Start a New Simulation
1. Open your browser and go to the Monte Carlo platform
2. Upload an Excel file or use an existing one
3. Select the **Power Engine**
4. Configure your Monte Carlo variables
5. Start the simulation

### 2. Monitor Backend Logs
Open a terminal and run this command to watch the backend logs in real-time:
```bash
docker logs -f project-backend-1 | grep -E "(Progress callback|Stage|Power Engine)"
```

### 3. What to Look For
With the debug logging I've added, you should see one of these patterns:

#### Pattern A: Progress Callbacks Working ‚úÖ
```
üîç Progress callback available: True
üîç Progress callback type: <class 'function'>
üì§ Calling progress callback for Stage 1 (initialization)
‚úÖ Progress callback for Stage 1 completed successfully
üì§ Calling progress callback for Stage 2 (parsing)
‚úÖ Progress callback for Stage 2 completed successfully
üì§ Calling progress callback for Stage 3 (analysis)
‚úÖ Progress callback for Stage 3 completed successfully
```

#### Pattern B: Progress Callbacks Not Available ‚ùå
```
üîç Progress callback available: False
‚ö†Ô∏è No progress callback available for Stage 1!
‚ö†Ô∏è No progress callback available for Stage 2!
‚ö†Ô∏è No progress callback available for Stage 3!
```

#### Pattern C: Progress Callbacks Failing ‚ùå
```
üì§ Calling progress callback for Stage 1 (initialization)
‚ùå Progress callback failed for Stage 1: [error message]
```

### 4. Check Progress Store
You can also check if progress is being stored in Redis:
```bash
# Get simulation ID from the logs (looks like: c0f1cf95-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
docker exec -it project-redis-1 redis-cli

# In Redis CLI:
KEYS *progress*
GET simulation_progress:[your-simulation-id]
```

### 5. Frontend Console
Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for these logs:
- `[UnifiedProgressTracker] üìä Processing progress update`
- `[UnifiedProgressTracker] üìä Calculated overall progress:`

## Expected Timeline

A typical Power Engine simulation should progress like this:
- **0-5 seconds**: Initialization (20%)
- **5-10 seconds**: Parsing Excel (40%)
- **10-15 seconds**: Formula Analysis (60%)
- **15-85 seconds**: Monte Carlo Simulation (80-95%)
- **85-90 seconds**: Generating Results (100%)

## Quick Diagnostics

### If stuck at 18%:
1. Check backend logs for "Progress callback available: False"
2. Look for any error messages about progress callbacks
3. Verify the simulation is actually running (look for "Power Engine simulation" logs)

### If no progress updates:
1. Check for "No progress callback available" warnings
2. Verify Redis is running: `docker ps | grep redis`
3. Check for connection errors in backend logs

## Share Your Findings

Please run a test simulation and share:
1. The pattern you see in the backend logs (A, B, or C from above)
2. Any error messages related to progress callbacks
3. The simulation ID from the logs
4. Whether the simulation eventually completes successfully

This will help me provide a targeted fix for the specific issue you're experiencing.
