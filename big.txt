**Big File Simulation Evaluation – 2025-06-24**

1. Summary of Observed Behaviour
   • Backend logs show the simulation never progresses past ~5 iterations (0/100 displayed as 0 in UI).  
   • FormulaMetrics reports 0 total/relevant formulas, yet the Excel model is known to contain thousands.  
   • Repeated ERROR entries:
     "Formula dependency analysis exceeded maximum iterations (100000). This indicates a very complex or circular dependency structure."  
   • After the error, helper/concurrency layers mark the simulation as failed, but the front-end keeps polling Redis progress which remains stuck at 5 %. Eventually the browser console logs appear blank because the server stops streaming new progress records.

2. Root Cause Analysis
   • The dependency-graph explorer in `backend/simulation/formula_utils.py -> get_evaluation_order()` performs a bounded breadth-first search (BFS) over precedent cells.  
   • `MAX_DEPENDENCY_NODES` is set to **100 000** for the Enhanced engine. Large files with >100 000 formula cells quickly breach this threshold even when only a subset is relevant.  
   • When the cap is reached, the code raises a `ValueError`, immediately aborting the simulation.  
   • Because the failure happens *before* the Monte-Carlo loop starts, `current_iteration` stays low and all variable-level progress bars remain red.
   • The front-end does not yet recognise this particular exception, so the UI never flips the card to "Failed"; instead it silently stalls.

3. Contributing Factors
   • No incremental cut-off: the BFS counts every visited node, including branches that may later be pruned.  
   • The dependency explorer is single-threaded Python and stores every explored tuple in memory – ~100 k nodes ≈ several hundred MB for very large workbooks.  
   • Cycle detection relies on the topological-sort fallback; a genuine circular reference inflates the node count and can create a worst-case O(N²) visit pattern.  
   • For 'streaming' mode we intentionally load *only* formulas from the sheets referenced by the target cells, but if the named ranges/tables point to entire worksheets we still pull huge graphs.

4. Recommendations
   A. **Raise Hard Limits Dynamically**  
      – Detect workbook size (total formulas) early; scale `MAX_DEPENDENCY_NODES` to `min(total_formulas * 1.2, 1_000_000)`.  
      – Provide an advanced toggle allowing admins to override limits per simulation.

   B. **True Cycle Detection Before BFS**  
      – Implement Tarjan's strongly-connected-components (SCC) algorithm to identify cycles in O(N+E) without crossing the hard node cap.  
      – Abort early with a user-friendly "Circular reference" message instead of generic max-iteration error.

   C. **Graph-Chunking & Lazy Expansion**  
      – Use a generator that yields dependencies chunk-by-chunk and persists interim results to Redis so the UI sees gradual progress (e.g., 1 % increments for every 10 k nodes).  
      – Only enqueue precedent cells that are on a path to the target variable (reverse slicing via reverse_graph) to avoid exploring unused sections.

   D. **Memory Footprint Reduction**  
      – Replace Python tuples with compact `namedtuple`/C struct or encode `(sheet_id << 32) | row_col_hash` as 64-bit integer.  
      – Use `array.array` or NumPy for queue storage when millions of nodes are possible.

   E. **UI Error Propagation**  
      – Extend the websocket event schema to include a `failure_reason` field; if present, the front-end should display a red "Failed" badge and stop polling.  
      – Log first 10 offending cells to help model authors fix circular references.

   F. **Horizontal Scalability**  
      – Off-load dependency analysis to a dedicated micro-service running on a high-memory instance (or GPU for graph kernels) so large models do not block regular simulation workers.  
      – Eventually distribute BFS across multiple processes using a work-stealing queue.

5. Next Steps / Action Plan
   1. Patch `formula_utils.py` to expose `--max-nodes` via environment variable; default 100 k, but allow >1 M for power users.  
   2. Add early workbook-size heuristic in `excel_parser/enhanced_formula_engine.py` so we can warn users before they hit the limit.  
   3. Implement quick UI fix: if backend returns HTTP 422/500 with "Formula dependency analysis exceeded...", surface it as a toast notification.  
   4. Schedule sprint to integrate Tarjan SCC algorithm and memory-efficient node encoding (2–3 days dev + testing).  
   5. Review container limits – ensure backend is started with `--memory=8g --memory-swap=10g` or adjust Kubernetes limits accordingly.

6. Long-Term Vision
   • Move from Python BFS to **GPU-accelerated graph traversal** utilising CUDA dynamic parallelism (nvGraph / cuGraph).  
   • Combine with *monolithic kernel fusion* to evaluate independent sub-graphs directly on the GPU, eliminating most host-side graph work.

7. Industry Benchmarks – How Excel-Based Monte-Carlo Platforms Cope With Huge Models
   • **Crystal Ball / Oracle** and **Palisade @RISK** delegate dependency resolution to Excel's *built-in* calculation graph; they never build the graph themselves.  
   • They rely on Excel's *dirty-flag* incremental recalc: only formulas downstream of changed assumptions are executed each iteration.  
   • Iterations are chunked into blocks that run in parallel copies of Excel; results are aggregated to keep memory usage predictable.  
   • Early workbook scans warn the user about circular references, volatile functions and sheer model size before a simulation begins.  
   • Result storage is streamed to unmanaged memory / temp files; only summary stats are kept in RAM unless the user requests full drill-down data.
   • Premium editions distribute iteration blocks to a cluster of machines; failures of one block do not cancel the whole run.

8. Roadmap to a Dedicated **"big"** Engine (handles 1 M+ formulas gracefully)

Phase 0  – Foundations (1 week)
   • Expose `BIG_MAX_NODES`, `BIG_TIMEOUT_SEC`, `BIG_BATCH_SIZE` via env vars / CLI.  
   • Add workbook-size heuristic in the parser; automatically select the **big** engine when `total_formulas > 100 k`.

Phase 1  – Incremental Graph Builder (2 weeks)
   • Implement Tarjan SCC cycle detection; fail fast with clear error if cycles remain.  
   • Replace tuple nodes with 64-bit encoded IDs to slash RAM.  
   • Write BFS as a generator that yields blocks of 10 k nodes and persists partial progress to Redis so the UI can display granular progress (1 % steps).

Phase 2 – Simulation Logic and Batch Evaluation

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Key Tasks:**
- Implement actual Monte Carlo simulation logic in `_run_big_simulation`
- Add batch evaluation of formulas with memory-efficient processing
- Stream results to Redis with chunked output
- Add timeout handling and error recovery
- Implement result aggregation and statistics

**Success Criteria:**
- BIG engine can run full Monte Carlo simulations on large files
- Memory usage stays under 4GB for 1M+ formula files
- Results are streamed to Redis in real-time
- Timeout handling prevents infinite loops
