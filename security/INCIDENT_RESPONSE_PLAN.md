# Security Incident Response Plan
## Monte Carlo Simulation Platform

### Incident Classification

#### Critical (P0) - Immediate Response Required
- Active security breach
- Data exfiltration
- System compromise
- Service unavailable due to security incident

#### High (P1) - Response within 2 hours
- Vulnerability exploitation attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Security control bypasses
- Suspicious user activity

#### Medium (P2) - Response within 24 hours
- Security alerts from monitoring
- Failed authentication patterns
- Configuration drift
- Compliance violations

#### Low (P3) - Response within 72 hours
- Security awareness issues
- Minor policy violations
- Routine security updates

### Response Procedures

#### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)
1. **Assess and Classify**
   - Determine incident severity
   - Identify affected systems
   - Document initial findings

2. **Contain**
   - Isolate affected systems if necessary
   - Preserve evidence
   - Prevent further damage

3. **Communicate**
   - Notify incident response team
   - Alert stakeholders based on severity
   - Document all actions

#### Investigation Phase (15 minutes - 4 hours)
1. **Evidence Collection**
   - Collect logs and system snapshots
   - Interview affected users
   - Document timeline of events

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Determine scope of impact
   - Assess data confidentiality

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Business impact analysis
   - Data breach assessment
   - Regulatory compliance impact

#### Recovery Phase (Varies by incident)
1. **System Restoration**
   - Clean and rebuild compromised systems
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Apply security patches

2. **Monitoring**
   - Enhanced monitoring for 30 days
   - Verify attack indicators are resolved
   - Monitor for reoccurrence

#### Post-Incident Phase
1. **Documentation**
   - Complete incident report
   - Lessons learned document
   - Update procedures

2. **Improvements**
   - Implement additional controls
   - Update security policies
   - Conduct training
