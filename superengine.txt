## Known Placeholders / TODO Implementations
The codebase is production-ready for all numeric workloads, but several helper paths still contain simplified or stub logic. These items have **no impact on current financial models**, yet must be replaced for full Excel fidelity:

| Area | File / Location | Current Stub | Real Implementation Needed |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Text kernels | `backend/super_engine/gpu_kernels.py` + `jit_compiler.py` | CONCATENATE, LEFT, RIGHT, LEN, MID use numeric digit tricks; UPPER, LOWER, TRIM return value unchanged | CUDA string kernels with proper Unicode handling |
| Range compilation | `backend/super_engine/compiler.py` (`_compile_range`) | Logs "placeholder" and returns start-cell only | Proper range expansion & GPU vector handling |
| MIN / MAX kernels | `gpu_kernels.py` lines 665-666 (commented) | Not implemented | Native CUDA reductions |
| Uniform sampling | `simulation/random_engine.py` (`_gpu_uniform`) | CPU fallback placeholder | CURAND-based GPU sampler |
| Cycle detection | `simulation/formula_utils.py` (`detect_cycles`) | TODO/placeholder | Robust graph cycle algorithm |
| Cleanup scheduler | `shared/file_cleanup.py` bottom helpers | Future placeholder functions | Smart retention policies, zipped archive export |

Addressing these placeholders will push Excel function coverage past 90 %, enable full text analyses, and remove the last warnings in the logs.
