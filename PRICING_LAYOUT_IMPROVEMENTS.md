# Pricing Layout Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Changes Made

I've fixed the pricing table layout issues and made it display by default. Here's what was implemented:

### âœ… **1. Always Visible Pricing**
- **Before**: Pricing was hidden behind a "View Plans" button
- **After**: Pricing table is now displayed by default on the Get Started page
- **Benefit**: Users can immediately see all plan options without extra clicks

### âœ… **2. Fixed Cut-off Layout Issues**
- **Container Width**: Changed from `maxWidth: '1200px'` to `width: '100%'`
- **Table Layout**: Added `tableLayout: 'fixed'` for consistent column widths
- **Minimum Width**: Set `minWidth: '1000px'` to prevent table compression
- **Overflow Handling**: Added `overflowX: 'auto'` for horizontal scrolling when needed

### âœ… **3. Equal Column Distribution**
- **Column Width**: Each column now uses `width: '16.66%'` (6 columns total)
- **Minimum Width**: Each column has `minWidth: '160px'` to prevent text cutting
- **Consistent Spacing**: All columns have equal width distribution

### âœ… **4. Enhanced Responsive Design**
- **Desktop (>1200px)**: Full table display with proper spacing
- **Tablet (768px-1200px)**: Horizontal scrolling with smooth touch support
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Automatic fallback to vertical card layout

### âœ… **5. Improved User Experience**
- **Immediate Access**: No need to click buttons to see pricing
- **Full Visibility**: All plan features are clearly visible in the table
- **Smooth Navigation**: "View Plans & Pricing" button now scrolls to pricing section
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, organized table that showcases all plan details
